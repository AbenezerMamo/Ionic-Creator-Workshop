####First Tab!
Now let's work on the first tab, "Home"

1. Click on the first tab and drag a "Card" from the components to the tab


![card](http://puu.sh/k8asM/8fc2d1c9dd.png)

2. Now drag a "Markdown" component directly *into* the card. You can add any text you want to the markdown!

The "Home" tab will display all of the updates from your clubs and show them in a card format. You may have seen this on apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Google Hangouts. 

####Second Tab!
Now let's work on the second tab, "Clubs"

1. Click on the second tab and drag a "Card" from the components to the tab

2. Go ahead and drag in a few buttons *into* the card. You can rename the buttons by click on them and editing their text on the right toolbar. In fact, you can change other attributes of the button to truly make it your own!

Each button should be the name of the clubs you are a part of! They will soon link to information about the club!

####Third Tab!
Now let's work on the third tab, "Profile"

1. Click on the third tab and drag an "Image" component to the tab! This tab will display your picture and name! Feel free to add more!

![profile](http://puu.sh/k8bB1/43e3b8ab2b.png)

Now we've completed the basics of our app! Users can see updates from their clubs on their Home page, view their clubs in the Clubs page, and view their profile on the Profile page. 

We've done a lot in little time! We've played a lot with Ionic Creator without having to write code but you can actually see the code behind what you just created! 

###Exporting your app!
The app you created looks great but wouldn't it be cool if everyone could have their own profile and their own clubs?! Well, you need to write code to add that functionality! Don't worry, you only need to learn Javascript to do it all!

1. Let's export the code we've been working on! Head over to the top-left of yoru page and press the export icon!


![export](http://puu.sh/k8bO9/075f772dab.png)

2. Export your work as a Zip File and save the file to your documents or a flash drive!

We will soon break down the code that powers the app you just created! You can make your app a whole lot more powerful! We hope you enjoyed the tutorial! See you next time!
